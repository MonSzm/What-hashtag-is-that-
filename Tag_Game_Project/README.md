# What-hashtag-is-that?

##1. Description

As the name suggests this game is about hashtags. 
Try to guess the hashtag based on the picture. 
Provide letters and see if you are right.
> **Remember: No risk, no fun!**

##2. The main rules
- Yes for Polish signs.
- Yes for Polish declension.
- Use input to provide whole hashtag.
  - ```ðŸ˜Š Good answer``` -> collect extra points
  - ```ðŸ˜• Almost good answer``` -> loose extra points
- Use keyboard to provide letters

##3. Scoring rules
**Provide letters one by one:**
- ðŸ˜Š Really good: one point for every correct letter
- ðŸ˜• Almost good: one negative point for wrong letter

**Provide WHOLE HASHTAG (without "#"):**
- ðŸ˜Š Really good: double point for all hidden letters
- ðŸ˜• Almost good: double negative point for all hidden letters

##4. Project workflow
This project has been prepared by using library React.js. 
It was really busy time because of necessity to take into consideration all possible options.


##5. To do in the next time
- Only three chances
- RWD for the main game (the second site)
- Provide total points on the last page - after finish the game
- Saving results of all users
- Letters provided too quickly - to solve this case

##GOOD LUCK!
